            - Output: Int (the maximum profit from one buy/sell transaction)
            - Constraints:
                - Must buy before selling (time moves forward only)
                - At most one transaction (one buy + one sell)
            - Edge cases:
                - Empty array → return 0
                - Single price → return 0 (can’t sell)

        Plan:
            - Initialize max_profit = 0 (no profit yet)
            - Initialize min_price = ∞ (start high, will update when a smaller values is seen)
            - For each price in the list:
                - Update min_price if we find a smaller price
                - Calculate profit = current price - min_price
                - Update max_profit if profit is greater
            - Return max_profit
